    <h1>My Testimony</h1>
    <p>How God led me out of a high-control religious group and into the freedom of knowing Jesus Christ.</p>
</header>

<div class="content">

    <div class="scripture">
        “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.”
        <span class="scripture-ref">Matthew 22:37</span>
    </div>

    <p>
        I cannot remember a time in my life when I did not love God with all my heart. What I did not understand, however, was that the God I loved so deeply was being presented to me through the lens of a high-control religious organization. I spent
        <strong>25 years as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses</strong>. I was taught that Jehovah had created the heavens and the earth and given many good things—but I also learned to see Him as a hard, exacting God who was difficult to please.
    </p>

    <p>
        From a young age, I believed I needed to be willing to turn my back on family and friends if they ever walked away from the organization. Any “wrong” decision of my own could result in <strong>shunning</strong>, leaving me isolated from everyone I knew and loved.
        I spent countless hours going door to door, sharing what we called <em>the good news.</em> Over time, I began to realize it wasn’t truly good news at all—it came with unbearable burdens and a system that broke apart families in the name of God.
    </p>

    <p>
        Eventually, questions began to stir in my heart—questions about the doctrines and teachings I had been told never to question. As I sought answers, God in His mercy led me not to a new organization, but to
        <strong>the real and living Savior, Jesus Christ</strong>. I surrendered my life to Him, and everything changed.
    </p>

    <div class="pullquote">
        I discovered a God who is not distant and demanding, but a loving Father full of <strong>Grace and Truth</strong>.
    </div>

    <p>
        I have now been out of the organization longer than I was in it. I understand the tactics that high-control religious groups use to keep people trapped, and my heart aches for those still inside. Today, I am a
        <strong>seminary student pursuing my Master of Divinity</strong>, loving the Lord my God with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength—just as Matthew 22:37 calls us to do.
    </p>

    <p>
        My deepest desire is to point as many people as I can to <strong>Jesus Christ, the true Savior</strong>, who offers freedom, forgiveness, and eternal life. I am passionate about equipping Christians to speak with Jehovah’s Witnesses in ways that encourage sincere
        questions—questions that can open the door for someone else to encounter <strong>the real Jesus</strong> and know Him as their Lord and Savior.
    </p>

    <p>
        All glory to God, who rescues, restores, and sets captives free.
